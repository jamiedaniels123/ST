<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3>Website/app Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, SportsTables collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SportsTables&rsquo;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SportsTables&rsquo;s visitors use its website so we can make improvements. From time to time, SportsTables may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>SportsTables avoids collecting potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses except to the extent necessary to provide certain services.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>SportsTables may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, SportsTables may monitor the most popular pages. SportsTables may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SportsTables does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Google App Engine</h3>
<p>Some of SportsTables's services may be provided by Google App Engine, a service operated by Google. As such, you should assume that any information you provide to SportsTables may be available to SportsTables and to Google. For details about the specific privacy guarantees made by Google, please refer to <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html">code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html</a>.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>SportsTables discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SportsTables&rsquo;s behalf or to provide services available at SportsTables&rsquo;s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SportsTables&rsquo;s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SportsTables will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SportsTables discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SportsTables believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SportsTables, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a SportsTables website and have supplied your email address, SportsTables may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&rsquo;s going on with SportsTables and our products. We primarily useTwitter to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SportsTables takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>

SportsTables visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SportsTables&rsquo;s websites, with the drawback that certain features of SportsTables&rsquo;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If SportsTables, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that SportsTables goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of SportsTables may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Except in the section &quot;Advertiser Cookies&quot; immediately below, this Privacy Policy discusses the use of cookies by SportsTables and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. For more information about advertiser cookies you should consult the privacy policies of the specific advertising networks you wish to learn more about.</p>
